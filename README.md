# Apple Watch Poketch

## What is it?

It's an Apple Watch remake of the "Poketch" from Pokemon Diamond and Pearl made with SwiftUI!

Check out the YouTube video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW62MN3cy_k) to see it in action!

## What devices can I run this on?

The only real limitation is screen size. Any full-screen Apple Watch should work (4 or above), though I haven't tested it on the Series 3. Feel free to give it a shot and report back how it goes! I'd imagine that simple apps like the digital watch should fit but more complex apps like the calculator will have elements cut off.

## How do I put this on my Apple Watch?

By sideloading! This is a pretty complicated and involved process that will probably only make sense if you're a developer, but [here's](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/running-your-app-in-the-simulator-or-on-a-device) Apple's documentation on running custom apps on your devices using Xcode.

## Will this be posted to the App Store?

Nope, this is a fan project of some fantastic games and I am in no position to publish this to the App Store as my own creation. Hopefully this will inspire an official Poketch app to be developed for smart watches at some point!

## What apps does it have?

All kinds!

I added the apps that seemed to make the most sense on an Apple Watch, as well as some of my favorites that gave the original Poketch its charm. If you want to see the project running, check out my video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW62MN3cy_k).
